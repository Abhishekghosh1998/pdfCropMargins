Currently just notes for using.

See 
https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#setup-args

To include a data file (presumably executable counts) you can use this:

    package_data={
        'sample': ['package_data.dat'],
        },

    Detailed info:
       https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#including-data-files

To include an executable script in a path, use this:

    console_scripts

        entry_points={
            'console_scripts': [
                'sample=sample:main',
            ],
        },

    Use “console_script” entry points to register your script interfaces. You
    can then let the toolchain handle the work of turning these interfaces into
    actual scripts [2]. The scripts will be generated during the install of
    your distribution.

    For more information, see Automatic Script Creation from the setuptools
    docs.

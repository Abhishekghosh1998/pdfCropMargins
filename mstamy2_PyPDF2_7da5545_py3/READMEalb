# __init__.py is a dummy file added by alb to make this dir a module so the import
# of the subdirectory PyPDF2 is easy using dotted names.  This whole directory
# was downloaded from
#    https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/
# and should not be modified.

# This Python 3 version was created by running 2to3 a few times on the Python
# files in the PyPDF2 directory of the regular version and then changing two
# lines in utils.py (the lines are marked with alb).

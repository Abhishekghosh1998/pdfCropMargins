Note that Ubuntu ships with its own version of pdfcrop!!!!
See man pdfcrop, Perl source in /usr/bin/pdfcrop.

This program uses pyPdf, which apparently has not currently been ported to Python 3.
But, pyPdf2 is a more recent fork which does support it!


==================== Dependencies =====================

The program requires the Python package pyPdf (or a fork like pyPdf2).  Note,
though, that a version of pyPdf2 is packaged with the program and it will
revert to that if a system version is not found (or if the command-line option
--pyPdfLocal is set).

Other dependencies depend on whether or not any options that require explicit
rendering are to be used.

   With explicit rendering the dependencies are:
   
       1) PIL (or some fork of it, like Pillow).

       2) Either Ghostscript or pdftoppm, but on Windows the program
       will automatically revert to a local version of an older pdftoppm.exe
       binary which is packaged with the system.
   
   Without explicit rendering Ghostscript is required (but PIL is not).

Note that Ubuntu ships with its own version of pdfcrop!!!!
See man pdfcrop, Perl source in /usr/bin/pdfcrop.

This program uses pyPdf, which apparently has not currently been ported to Python 3.
But, pyPdf2 is a more recent fork which does support it!


==================== Dependencies =====================

The program requires the Python package pyPdf (or a fork like pyPdf2).  Note,
though, that a version of pyPdf2 is packaged with the program and it will
revert to that if a system version is not found (or if the command-line option
--pyPdfLocal is set).

Other dependencies depend on whether or not any options that require explicit
rendering are to be used.

   For selected options requiring explicit rendering the dependencies are:
   
       1) PIL (or some fork of it, like Pillow).

       2) Either Ghostscript or pdftoppm, but on Windows the program
       will automatically revert to a local version of an older pdftoppm.exe
       binary which is packaged with the system.
   
   For selected options not explicit requiring rendering Ghostscript is
   required (but PIL is not).

Ghostscript is standard in most Linux distributions, and is easy to install
on Windows and in Cygwin.

The pdftoppm program is standard in most Linux distributions, and is easy
to install in Windows and Cygwin.  It is currently part of the Poppler
pdf tools, so that package should be installed.

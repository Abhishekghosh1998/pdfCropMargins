Note that Ubuntu ships with its own version of pdfcrop!!!!
See man pdfcrop, Perl source in /usr/bin/pdfcrop.

This program uses pyPdf, which apparently has not currently been ported to Python 3.
But, pyPdf2 is a more recent fork which does support it!


==================== Dependencies =====================

The program requires the Python package pyPdf (or a fork like pyPdf2).  Note,
though, that a version of pyPdf2 is packaged with the program and it will
revert to that if a system version is not found (or if the command-line option
--pyPdfLocal is set).

Other dependencies depend on whether or not any options that require explicit
rendering are to be used.

   For selected options requiring explicit rendering the dependencies are:
   
       1) PIL (or some fork of it, like Pillow).

       2) Either Ghostscript or pdftoppm, but on Windows the program
       will automatically revert to a local version of an older pdftoppm.exe
       binary which is packaged with the system.
   
   For selected options not explicit requiring rendering Ghostscript is
   required (but PIL is not).

==================

# gs

Ghostscript is standard in most Linux distributions, and is easy to install
on Windows and in Cygwin.  The Windows install page is at
   http://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html
and the non-commercial GPL version should work fine for most people.

# pdftoppm

The pdftoppm program is standard in most Linux distributions, and is easy
to install in Cygwin.  It is currently part of the Poppler
pdf tools, so that package should be installed.

In Windows pdftoppm is not as easy to install, but a local version of pdftoppm
comes packaged the pdfCropMargins program.  It should be automatically detected
on Windows Python.  Note that the local version only runs when pdfCropMargins
is run with Windows Python.  It does not work when pdfCropMargins is run from
Cygwin Python (but Poppler is easy to install in Cygwin).  It does work from
Windows Python when launched from either a Windows command prompt or from a
Cygwin command prompt.

# Python

For Cygwin Python, be sure to install the package with Python Imaging Library
(PIL or Pillow).  A recent pyPdf (or a compatible fork) would be good, too, but
there is a local version packaged with the program.  If the import fails the
program will revert to the local version.

For Windows Python, be sure to install the Python Imaging Library (PIL or
Pillow) or use a package like Python(x,y) where you can easily add it as a
plugin.  A recent pyPdf (or a compatible fork) would be good, too, but there
is a local version packaged with the program.  If the import fails the program
will revert to the local version.
